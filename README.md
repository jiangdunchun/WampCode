WebAssembly Code
==============

# Introduction
This [page](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) introduces how to install Emscripten, a compiler for WebAssembly. I used the Ubantu as the develop environment.

# Notice
In my Ubantu, the Emscripten need to be compiled every time system was restarted. 
```
//cd to emsdk firstly
//compile Emscripten

cd emsdk
source ./emsdk_env.sh --build=Release

```
